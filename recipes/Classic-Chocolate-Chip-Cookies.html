    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
