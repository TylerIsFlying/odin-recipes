        <p>Yakisoba Chicken is a popular and flavorful 
            Japanese dish that combines tender pieces of 
            chicken with yakisoba noodles, a variety of 
            vegetables, and a rich, savory sauce. The dish is t
            ypically prepared by stir-frying the chicken and vegetables 
            such as cabbage, carrots, and onions in a hot wok or 
            frying pan, ensuring they retain their crispness and 
            vibrant colors. The noodles are then added to the mix, 
            along with a distinctive yakisoba sauce that lends the 
            dish its unique taste—a combination of sweet, salty, and 
            slightly tangy flavors, often enhanced with a hint of spice. 
            Yakisoba Chicken is frequently garnished with seaweed flakes, 
            pickled ginger, or bonito flakes before serving, adding an extra 
            layer of texture and flavor. It's a versatile meal that can be 
            enjoyed at any time of the day and is beloved for its satisfying 
            combination of ingredients, making it a staple in Japanese cuisine 
            and a favorite among food enthusiasts worldwide.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste; 
                    stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an 
                    additional 30 seconds. Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the 
                    soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is no longer pink, 
                    about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and keep warm.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In the emptied pan combine the onion, 
                    cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry until 
                    cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
